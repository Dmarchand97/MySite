            <p> I have been a Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments for the past 2+ years. 
              I have worked with mostly Java, Oracle SQL, and Spring Boot.
               Along with Junit and karate automation testing I know to how cover code well and debug like the best of them.
               With these I've been able to process data faster for Corprate Action Reports for clients during a merge, aquisition, or stock split. 
               I am now working on DCI which helps onboard new clinets and thier employees to use Fidelitys workplace investments.
